RIT Professor Ratings
=====================

I'm trying to solve an efficiency problem that arises when planning classes for enrollment. To cut down on the amount of time navigating back and forth between classsearch.rit.edu and ratemyprofessors.com I will provide each Professor's stats under their name in the Class Search results. This will probably be visible on-click of a little arrow next to the Prof's name, or something of the sort.

This functionality will exist in a Chrome Extension, and it might get ported to other browsers in the future, when I've had more sleep.

Status
------
Currently BLOCKING on RateMyProfessors lacking a public API. A message was sent to the site overlords today (Nov 17 2015) and a response is not on my list of things to expect this Christmas. Will probably have to resort to page scraping. Hooray.

Feature Requests/Bugs
---------------------
Fork & send a Pull Request, or feed me coffee until this does what you desire.

Do whatever you want!

Alternatively, if you feel so inclined, I accept donations in the form of hugs, good coffee, and compliments.
